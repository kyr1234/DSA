/*Leetcode 461. Hamming Distance

 The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the 
 corresponding bits are different.

 Question: Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance.

 the two integers will be in range ( 0<= x,y < 2^31 ) */

            x /= 2; //same as left shift operation
